# Cybertruck

This now an app, [CarPrep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carprep/id6670447342), on the App Store! 

This is a comprehensive guide on preparing for, taking delivery of, and owning a Tesla Cybertruck.

I couldn't find a good resource for the soup-to-nuts process of buying a Model 3, [so I made one](https://github.com/mykeln/teslaprep/blob/master/README.md). This document is adapted from that, taking the Cybertruck's uniqueness into consideration.

We are still many years out from the first delivery of the Cybertruck. No official release date has been announced, but it is expected that the Cybertruck will enter production in late 2021, with estimated deliveries beginning in early 2022.

Nevertheless, it's never too early to become part of the Tesla community.

### Reserve a Cybertruck
Head over to the [designer](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design) and reserve a Cybertruck.

1.  You will put down a $100 fully-refundable deposit to reserve your place in line.
2.  Don't worry about picking the perfect configuration. Once the Cybertruck enters production, you will have the option of confirming the exact configuration you'd like. Everything is subject to change.

The deposit is simply a way to get "first dibs" on the earliest Cybertrucks as they're delivered off the production line.

Once you click "Order," you'll be presented with a reservation number (something like RN1834404). These numbers are sequential, so you can get a sense of how many people are ahead of you in line.

You should receive an email confirmation of your reservation the next day.

Congratulations! You've reserved a Cybertruck. That was easy. Unfortunately, it only gets harder from here. Now comes the hardest part: waiting.

### While you wait
Participate in the Tesla community.

1.  Attend a [Tesla owner orientation event](https://www.tesla.com/events). You will meet other owners and learn lots of handy tips about general ownership, driving and living with a Tesla.
2.  Join the [official Tesla forum](https://forums.tesla.com/), the unofficial [Tesla Motors Club forum](https://teslamotorsclub.com/), and [r/teslamotors](http://reddit.com/r/teslamotors) subreddit.

This document will be updated as new details on the Cybertruck come to light.
